      Makers was founded in 2016 by three engineering students as an effort to promote
      more innovation and interest in electronics at the University of Southern California.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, we have built over <i>seventy</i> projects (which you can check out here!) and
      are currently working on another eleven!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond our projects, we are a tight-knit organization that strives to give back to our
      members and our community! All Makers have the opportunity to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn practical engineering skills through our <b>tutorial program</b></li>
      <li>Refine their resumes and interview skills through our <b>outreach program</b></li>
      <li>Receive guidance and advice through our <b>mentorship program</b></li>
      <li>Build lifelong friendships and connections through our <b>events program</b></li>
      <li>Develop leadership skills by becoming a <b>Project Manager</b> or <b>E-Board Member</b></li>
</ul>

    We are very grateful to the USC Ming Hsieh Institute, who fully sponsor our projects. 
    Without them, none of this magic could happen! A huge thank you to our other sponsors as well, 
    for providing us with the resources for guest and industry speakers, 
    as well as the resources to hold successful, 
    exciting showcases that invite our community to see our hard work!
