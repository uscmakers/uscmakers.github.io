Players make moves by interacting with a web application built with React that contains voice recognition logic and a basic UI displaying the game board. These moves are then sent through HTTP requests to a Python Flask server running on a Raspberry Pi, which processes the moves and controls the stepper motors and electromagnets that carry the pieces across the physical board. Each chess piece contains a magnet sitting at its bottom that is attracted by the electromagnet moving under the board. The pieces also break open when captured, achieved by reversing the polarity of the electromagnet to flip the magnet within the piece above and trigger the sides of the price to fall open.
