The system includes an iOS app, ESP-32 CAM microcontroller, and a Node.js server. BLE connects the iOS app to the ESP-32 CAM and regular HTTPS is used to connect the app to the server. A speaker on the microcontroller streams microphone data to the app for voice recognition. Then, the recognized text is sent to the server where it is proxied to DialogFlow to handle bot responses. The bot response is parsed by the app which commands the ESP-32 to take a picture or turn on a light. </p>

The goal of the project was to show that Robotic animals can be aesthetically pleasing as well as cool. This was done by attempting to attach a tail and fixing the head of the dog.<br>One of the biggest parts of this project was learning how to use the Robot Operating System and it also required a lot of CAD knowledge. This project is purely mechanical, and took a lot of time to do because we were still learning how to 3D print things. <br> This will not be the last time this dog will be seen as the goal is to still have it more functional, during the time of showcase one of the big issues was learning how servos worked. As it turned out the servos were not calibrated properly so the goal is to fix the calibrations so we can have a walking dog. </p>

The user enters a location on an intuitive dial UI and then presses the trigger button. The raspberry pi inside then makes a request for google earth images of that location and stitches them together. Finally, it projects the final picture with the addition of a spinning portal behind it through an hdmi connection to the mini projector inside. This involved use of the google earth api, image stitching, opencv, soldering components together, and designing and 3d printing a shell. </p>

                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">The goal of our project was to create a real-life version of Wizard's Chess from Harry Potter, in which chess pieces move autonomously across a board as dictated by player voice commands. Players make moves by interacting with a web application built with React that contains voice recognition logic and a basic UI displaying the game board. These moves are then sent through HTTP requests to a Python Flask server running on a Raspberry Pi, which processes the moves and controls the stepper motors and electromagnets that carry the pieces across the physical board. Each chess piece contains a magnet sitting at its bottom that is attracted by the electromagnet moving under the board. The pieces also break open when captured, achieved by reversing the polarity of the electromagnet to flip the magnet within the piece above and trigger the sides of the price to fall open. This mechanism was created by 3D printing each piece to have 2 mirrored sides held together by hinges.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Dealer No Deal is a BlackJack card dealing robot that makes the game a little more interesting if you know what you're looking for. By knowing the secret code of button inputs, the hidden camera in the robot looks at the next card about to be played and lets the player know whether they should Hit or Stand. The goal of this project is to help me make some money by scamming the rest of Makers :P and never lose at BlackJack. The robot is made of custom 3d printed parts and a dual-roller system to ensure that cards are accurately dealt. The software uses a python script for the BlackJack game logic as well as OpenCV on a pi camera for the card vision system.</p>

Our device uses computer vision to detect a mask on someone's face, and consequently unlocks or locks the door to your establishment. It works on everyone, from your neighborhood Karens to your neighborhood dogs. MASK OFF implements a face mask detection model that prevents non-maskers from entering a unit. All a user has to do is press a button, and based on whether our camera detects a mask or not, a signal is sent to a raspberry pi that unlocks a door. We initially implemented an open source neural network model using Keras and Tensorflow. Then, we integrated the model with the raspberry pi in order to have a button set off the unlocking signal.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">SpacePainter is a multi-axis CNC light painting robot. Essentially, it is a robotic arm that moves an LED in programmed patterns. When photographed by a long-exposure camera, the robot's path gets traced out in space by the light. It can be used to create cool effects in photos or as a multimedia installation piece. It is built with custom 3D printed parts and is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. It uses two stepper motors to move and an Adafruit Neopixel as an LED.  Over the course of this semester, we have designed, built, and programmed the entire robot from scratch. The robot can paint five different light paintings and we are working on adding more! </p>

You can make moves using voice commands, and X and O pieces will move across the board to the correct locations on the grid. You can also either play against a friend, or against an AI at three different difficulty levels. To implement speech recognition, we used a React web app and React API that listens to your voice through any laptop microphone. The moves you make are then sent back to our Python back-end which utilizes the Flask web framework. Here, our AI algorithm determines what moves to make in response, and our motor control code moves stepper motors to place pieces on the physical grid. The board itself is a 2 axis motor stage with linear slides, pulleys, and 3D-printed mounts. An electromagnet that is moved around by the motors turns on and off to pull magnetic pieces across the top of the board.</p>

The robot then uses information from the sleeve to mimic the user's motions. To build this project, we used CAD skills to model the arm, electrical engineering skills to wire the robots, and embedded programming & robotics skills to get the arm and sensors working.</p>

It uses Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with peripheral devices located on your wallet, keys and any other essentials you don't want to leave behind. If the system detects you leaving the house without any of these, it will buzz, reminding you that you left something behind.</p>

DJ Roomba required a variety of technical skills, covering a lot from both hardware and software. Our work mainly fit into either embedded development, computer vision, or the general, overarching category of robotics.</p>

The spider can be controlled either through a direct connection to the BeagleBone Blue or wirelessly with a controller.

It has the unique feature of complimenting you when you get closer to it (with the help of an ultrasonic sensor). We configured the brain of the mirror (the raspberry pi) with modules from an open source framework and modified them for our mirror. We also built our frame from scratch. Our team got to explore all types of fun technologies and modules through building this mirror, and had the best time putting it together!</p>

We built and designed the physical machine from the frame and various apparatuses to brew the tea and put in the necessary ingredients to make delicious boba. We also connected the machine to a phone app where you tell it when to start and how to adjust sweetness. Overall, we're a really chill team who likes to have fun but also get work done. This project involves many different components - mobile app design, CAD, working with motors/sensors, IoT integration, working with tools (i.e. drill, band saw, hammer), and is very hands on.</p>

To create the wearable tracker, we used currently existing wearable technology combined with biosensors to track physical symptoms of decreased attention span, including heart rate, body temperature, and galvanic skin response. The sensors, combined with a wifi-enabled microcontroller, are packaged into one single glove, allowing for the child’s ease of wear and durability.</p>
