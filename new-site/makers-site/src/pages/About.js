            Makers was founded in 2016 by three engineering students as an
            effort to promote more innovation and interest in electronics at the
            University of Southern California.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, we have built over <i>seventy</i> projects (which you
            can check out here!) and are currently working on another eleven!
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond our projects, we are a tight-knit organization that strives
            to give back to our members and our community! All Makers have the
            opportunity to:

            We are very grateful to the USC Ming Hsieh Institute, who fully
            sponsor our projects. Without them, none of this magic could happen!
            A huge thank you to our other sponsors as well, for providing us
            with the resources for guest and industry speakers, as well as the
            resources to hold successful, exciting showcases!
          </p>

            Makers!
